    <h2>Making the Most of Your Party Bus Experience</h2>

    <p>To get the most out of your rental, planning ahead is key. AG Town Cars recommends confirming your <strong>guest list and vehicle size</strong> early, since buses vary in capacity. Build in extra time for stops or delays, as additional hours may incur extra fees depending on availability.</p>

    <p>Create a playlist, bring along party essentials, and coordinate your itinerary with the chauffeur so everything runs smoothly. Most importantly, enjoy the ride - after all, the party bus is designed to make the <strong>journey itself an unforgettable part of your event</strong>.</p>

Considering that a party bus replaces multiple taxis or rideshares - and adds an onboard entertainment experience - it often represents great value for groups who want both fun and convenience.</p>

    <p>For larger events, booking in advance is recommended, especially during weekends or holiday seasons when demand peaks.</p>
